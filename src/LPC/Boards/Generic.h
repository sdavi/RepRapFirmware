// List of assignable pins and their mapping from names to MPU ports. This is indexed by logical pin number.
// The names must match user input that has been concerted to lowercase and had _ and - characters stripped out.
// Aliases are separate by the , character.
// If a pin name is prefixed by ! then this means the pin is hardware inverted. The same pin may have names for both the inverted and non-inverted cases,
// for example the inverted heater pins on the expansion connector are available as non-inverted servo pins on a DFueX.

//assumes user are selecting correct pins, and correctly setup etc so we will set most pins as rwpwm (since any pin can do PWM on a timer as long as there are free slots available)
